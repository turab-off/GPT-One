What does n8n mean?
Short answer: It means “nodemation” and is pronounced as n-eight-n.
Long answer: “I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it
is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a
free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already
taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. ‘node-’ in the sense that it uses a Node-View
and that it uses Node.js and ‘-mation’ for ‘automation’ which is what the project is
supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not
imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up
on ‘n8n’.” - Jan Oberhauser, Founder and CEO, n8n.io

Debugging Flaky End-to-End Tests - Usage
To debug flaky end-to-end (E2E) tests, use the following command:
pnpm run debug:flaky:e2e -- <grep_filter> <burn_count>
Parameters:
● <grep_filter>: (Optional) A string to filter tests by their it() or describe() block
titles, or by tags if using the @cypress/grep plugin. If omitted, all tests will be run.
● <burn_count>: (Optional) The number of times to run the filtered tests. Defaults to
5 if not provided.
Examples:
1. Run all tests tagged with CAT-726 ten times:
pnpm run debug:flaky:e2e CAT-726 10
2. Run all tests containing “login” five times (default burn count):
pnpm run debug:flaky:e2e login
3. Run all tests five times (default grep and burn count):

pnpm run debug:flaky:e2e

This :tv: short video (< 4 min) goes over key concepts of creating workflows in n8n.

Available integrations
n8n has 200+ different nodes to automate workflows. A full list can be found at
https://n8n.io/integrations.
Documentation
The official n8n documentation can be found at https://docs.n8n.io.
Additional information and example workflows are available on the website at
https://n8n.io.
Start n8n in Docker
In the terminal, enter the following:
docker volume create n8n_data
docker run 
-it --rm \
--name n8n \
-p 5678:5678 \
-v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
This command will download the required n8n image and start your container. You can
then access n8n by opening: http://localhost:5678
To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume,
n8n_data. The workflow data gets saved in an SQLite database in the user folder
(/home/node/.n8n). This folder also contains important data like the webhook URL and
the encryption key used for securing credentials.
If this data can’t be found at startup n8n automatically creates a new key and any
existing credentials can no longer be decrypted.
Start n8n with tunnel
WARNING: This is only meant for local development and testing and should
NOT be used in production!
n8n must be reachable from the internet to make use of webhooks - essential for
triggering workflows from external web-based services such as GitHub. To make this
easier, n8n has a special tunnel service which redirects requests from our servers to
your local n8n instance. You can inspect the code running this service here:
https://github.com/n8n-io/localtunnel
To use it simply start n8n with --tunnel
docker volume create n8n_data

docker run -it --rm \
--name n8n \
-p 5678:5678 \
-v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n 
\
start 
--tunnel
Use with PostgreSQL
By default, n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows.
However, n8n also supports using PostgreSQL.
WARNING: Even when using a different database, it is still important to persist
the /home/node/.n8n folder, which also contains essential n8n user data
including the encryption key for the credentials.
In the following commands, replace the placeholders (depicted within angled brackets,
e.g. <POSTGRES_USER>) with the actual data:
docker volume create n8n_data
docker run 
-it --rm \
--name n8n \
-p 5678:5678 \
-e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \
-e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \
-e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \
-e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \
-e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \
-e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \
-e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
-v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
A full working setup with docker-compose can be found here.
Passing sensitive data using files
To avoid passing sensitive information via environment variables, “_FILE” may be
appended to some environment variable names. n8n will then load the data from a file
with the given name. This makes it possible to load data easily from Docker and
Kubernetes secrets.
The following environment variables support file input:
● DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE
● DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE
● DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE
● DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE

● DB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE
● DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE
Example server setups
Example server setups for a range of cloud providers and scenarios can be found in the
Server Setup documentation.
Updating
Before you upgrade to the latest version make sure to check here if there are any
breaking changes which may affect you: Breaking Changes
From your Docker Desktop, navigate to the Images tab and select Pull from the context
menu to download the latest n8n image.
You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:
Pull latest (stable) version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
Pull specific version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:0.220.1
Pull next (unstable) version
docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next
Stop the container and start it again:
1. Get the container ID:
docker ps -a
2. Stop the container with ID container_id:
docker stop [container_id]
3. Remove the container (this does not remove your user data) with ID
container_id:
docker rm [container_id]
4. Start the new container:
docker run --name=[container_name] [options] -d 
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
Updating with Docker Compose
If you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:
# Pull latest version
docker compose pull

# Stop and remove older version
docker compose down
# Start the container
docker compose up 
-d
Setting the timezone
To specify the timezone n8n should use, the environment variable GENERIC_TIMEZONE
can be set. One example where this variable has an effect is the Schedule node.
The system’s timezone can be set separately with the environment variable TZ. This
controls the output of certain scripts and commands such as $ date.
For example, to use the same timezone for both:
docker run -it --rm \
--name n8n \
-p 5678:5678 \
-e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin" \
-e TZ="Europe/Berlin" \
docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
For more information on configuration and environment variables, please see the n8n
documentation.
Build Docker-Image
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --build-arg
N8N_VERSION=
<VERSION> -t n8n:<VERSION> 
.
# For example:
docker buildx build 
--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --build-arg
N8N_VERSION=1.30.1 
-t 
n8n:1.30.1 .
What does n8n mean and how do you pronounce it?
Short answer: It means “nodemation” and it is pronounced as n-eight-n.
Long answer: I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it
is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a
free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already
taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. “node-” in the sense that it uses a
Node-View and that it uses Node.js and “-mation” for “automation” which is what the
project is supposed to help with. However, I did not like how long the name was and I
could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then
ended up on “n8n”. Sure it does not work perfectly but neither does it for Kubernetes
(k8s) and I did not hear anybody complain there. So I guess it should be ok.

packages/@n8n/di/README.md
@n8n/di
@n8n/di is a dependency injection (DI) container library, based on typedi.
n8n no longer uses typedi because:
● typedi is no longer officially maintained
● Need for future-proofing, e.g. stage-3 decorators
● Small enough that it is worth the maintenance burden
● Easier to customize, e.g. to simplify unit tests

Usage
// from https://github.com/typestack/typedi/blob/develop/README.md
import { Container, Service } from 'typedi';
@
Service
()
class 
ExampleInjectedService {
printMessage
() {
console.log('I am alive!');
}
}
@
Service
()
class 
ExampleService {
constructor
(
// because we annotated ExampleInjectedService with the @Service()
// decorator TypeDI will automatically inject an instance of
// ExampleInjectedService here when the ExampleService class is requested
// from TypeDI.
public injectedService: 
ExampleInjectedService
) {}
}
const serviceInstance = Container.get(ExampleService);
// we request an instance of ExampleService from TypeDI
serviceInstance
.injectedService.printMessage();
// logs "I am alive!" to the console

packages/@n8n/json-schema-to-zod/README.md
Json-Schema-to-Zod
A package to convert JSON schema (draft 4+) objects into Zod schemas in the form of
Zod objects at runtime.
Installation
npm install @n8n/json-schema-to-zod
Simple example
import { jsonSchemaToZod } from "json-schema-to-zod";
const jsonSchema = 
{
type
: "object",
properties
: 
{
hello
: 
{
type
: "string",
}
,
}
,
}
;
const zodSchema = jsonSchemaToZod(myObject);
Overriding a parser
You can pass a function to the overrideParser option, which represents a function that
receives the current schema node and the reference object, and should return a zod
object when it wants to replace a default output. If the default output should be used for
the node just return undefined.

Overview
createVectorStoreNode is a factory function that generates n8n nodes for vector store
operations. It abstracts the common functionality needed for vector stores while allowing
specific implementations to focus only on their unique aspects.
Purpose
The function provides a standardized way to: 1. Create vector store nodes with
consistent UIs 2. Handle different operation modes (load, insert, retrieve, update,
retrieve-as-tool) 3. Process documents and embeddings 4. Maintain connection to LLM
services
Architecture

Usage
To create a new vector store node:
import { createVectorStoreNode } from './createVectorStoreNode';
export class 
MyVectorStoreNode {

// Functions to implement
getVectorStoreClient
: async (context, filter, embeddings, itemIndex) => 
{
// Create and return vector store instance
}
,
populateVectorStore
: async (context, embeddings, documents, itemIndex) =>
{
// Insert documents into vector store
}
,
// Optional: cleanup function - called in finally blocks after operations

releaseVectorStoreClient: (vectorStore) => 
{
// Release resources such as database connections or external clients
// For example, in PGVector: vectorStore.client?.release();
}
,
})
;
}
Operation Modes
1. load Mode
● Retrieves documents from the vector store based on a query
● Embeds the query and performs similarity search
● Returns ranked documents with their similarity scores
2. insert Mode
● Processes documents from input
● Embeds and stores documents in the vector store
● Returns serialized documents with metadata
● Supports batched processing with configurable embedding batch size
3. retrieve Mode
● Returns the vector store instance for use with AI nodes
● Allows LLMs to query the vector store directly
● Used with chains and retrievers
4. retrieve-as-tool Mode
● Creates a tool that wraps the vector store
● Allows AI agents to use the vector store as a tool
● Returns documents in a format digestible by agents
5. update Mode (optional)
● Updates existing documents in the vector store by ID
● Requires the vector store to support document updates
● Only enabled if included in operationModes
● Uses addDocuments method with an ids array to update specific documents
● Processes a single document per item and applies it to the specified ID
● Validates that only one document is being updated per operation
Key Components
1. NodeConstructorArgs Interface
Defines the configuration and callbacks that specific vector store implementations must
provide:

Note: In node version 1.1+, the populateVectorStore function must handle
receiving multiple documents at once for batch processing.
interface VectorStoreNodeConstructorArgs<T extends VectorStore> 
{
meta
: NodeMeta; // Node metadata (name, description,
etc.)
methods
?: { ... }; // Optional methods for list searches
sharedFields
: INodeProperties[]; // Fields shown in all modes
insertFields
?: INodeProperties[]; // Fields specific to insert mode
loadFields
?: INodeProperties[]; // Fields specific to load mode
retrieveFields
?: INodeProperties[]; // Fields specific to retrieve mode
updateFields
?: INodeProperties[]; // Fields specific to update mode
// Core implementation functions
populateVectorStore
: Function; // Store documents in vector store
(accepts batches in v1.1+)
getVectorStoreClient
: Function; // Get vector store instance
releaseVectorStoreClient
?: Function; // Clean up resources
}
2. Operation Handlers
Each operation mode has its own handler module with a well-defined interface:
// Example: loadOperation.ts
export async function handleLoadOperation<T extends VectorStore>
(
context
: IExecuteFunctions,
args
: VectorStoreNodeConstructorArgs<T>,
embeddings
: Embeddings,
itemIndex
: number
)
: Promise<INodeExecutionData[]>
// Example: insertOperation.ts (v1.1+)
export async function handleInsertOperation<T extends VectorStore>
(
context
: IExecuteFunctions,
args
: VectorStoreNodeConstructorArgs<T>,
embeddings
: 
Embeddings
)
: Promise<INodeExecutionData[]>
3. Document Processing
The processDocument function standardizes how documents are handled:
const { processedDocuments, serializedDocuments } = await processDocument
(
documentInput
,
itemData
,
itemIndex
)
;

Implementation Details
Error Handling and Resource Management
Each operation handler includes error handling with proper resource cleanup. The
releaseVectorStoreClient function is called in a finally block to ensure resources are
released even if an error occurs:
try 
{
// Operation logic
} 
finally 
{
// Release resources even if an error occurs
args
.releaseVectorStoreClient?.(vectorStore);
}
When releaseVectorStoreClient is called:
● After completing a similarity search in loadOperation
● As part of the closeFunction in retrieveOperation to release resources when
they’re no longer needed
● After each tool use in retrieveAsToolOperation
● After updating documents in updateOperation
● After inserting documents in insertOperation
This design ensures proper resource management, which is especially important for
database-backed vector stores (like PGVector) that need to return connections to a
pool. Without proper cleanup, prolonged usage could lead to resource leaks or
connection pool exhaustion.
Dynamic Tool Creation
For the retrieve-as-tool mode, a DynamicTool is created that exposes vector store
functionality:
const vectorStoreTool = new DynamicTool
({
name
: toolName,
description
: toolDescription,
func
: async (input) => 
{
// Search vector store with input
// ...
}
,
})
;
Performance Considerations
1. Resource Management: Each operation properly handles resource cleanup with
releaseVectorStoreClient.

2. Batched Processing: The insert operation processes documents in configurable
batches. In node version 1.1+, a single embedding operation is performed for all
documents in a batch, significantly improving performance by reducing API calls.
3. Metadata Filtering: Filters can be applied during search operations to reduce
result sets.
4. Execution Cancellation: The code checks for cancellation signals to stop
processing when needed.

packages/@n8n/utils/src/search/snapshots/README.md
Search snapshots
This directory contains snapshots containing real data fed into the sublimeSearch
function.
These were obtained via console.log(items) right before the sublimeSearch call in
editor-ui (currently in
packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/Node/NodeCreator/utils.ts) Which is
triggered by typing in the search bar in varying states of the application:
● toplevel: From an empty workflow (so missing e.g. tools)
After typing in the search bar you should see an object in the console you can copy via
`Right Click->Copy Object” which will cleanly paste to json.
Please use Chrome for capturing these - the recovered object in Chrome is about 3x
larger than in Firefox due to Firefox dropping some nested values

n8n Chat
This is an embeddable Chat widget for n8n. It allows the execution of AI-Powered
Workflows through a Chat window.

Windowed Example

Fullscreen Example
Prerequisites
Create a n8n workflow which you want to execute via chat. The workflow has to be
triggered using a Chat Trigger node.
Open the Chat Trigger node and add your domain to the Allowed Origins (CORS) field.
This makes sure that only requests from your domain are accepted.
See example workflow
Make sure the workflow is Active.
How it works
Each Chat request is sent to the n8n Webhook endpoint, which then sends back a
response.
Each request is accompanied by an action query parameter, where action can be one
of: - loadPreviousSession - When the user opens the Chatbot again and the previous
chat session should be loaded - sendMessage - When the user sends a message
Installation
Open the Webhook node and replace YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL with your
production URL. This is the URL that the Chat widget will use to send requests to.

a. CDN Embed
Add the following code to your HTML page.
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@n8n/chat/dist/style.css"
rel
="stylesheet" />
<script type="module">
import { createChat } from
'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@n8n/chat/dist/chat.bundle.es.js';
createChat
({
webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL'
})
;
</script>
b. Import Embed
Install and save n8n Chat as a production dependency.
npm install @n8n/chat

d
i18n in n8n
Scope
n8n allows for internalization of the majority of UI text:

● base text, e.g. menu display items in the left-hand sidebar menu,
● node text, e.g. parameter display names and placeholders in the node view,
● credential text, e.g. parameter display names and placeholders in the credential
modal,
● header text, e.g. node display names and descriptions at various spots.
Currently, n8n doesnot allow for internalization of:
● messages from outside the editor-ui package, e.g. No active database
connection,
● strings in certain Vue components, e.g. date time picker
● node subtitles, e.g. create: user or getAll: post below the node name on the
canvas,
● new version notification contents in the updates panel, e.g. Includes node
enhancements, and
● options that rely on loadOptionsMethod.
Pending functionality:
● Search in nodes panel by translated node name
● UI responsiveness to differently sized strings
● Locale-aware number formatting
Locale identifiers
A locale identifier is a language code compatible with the Accept-Language header,
e.g. de (German), es (Spanish), ja (Japanese). Regional variants of locale identifiers,
such as -AT in de-AT, arenot supported. For a list of all locale identifiers, see column
639-1 in this table.
By default, n8n runs in the en (English) locale. To have run it in a different locale, set the
N8N_DEFAULT_LOCALE environment variable to a locale identifier. When running in a
non-en locale, n8n will display UI strings for the selected locale and fall back to en for
any untranslated strings.
export N8N_DEFAULT_LOCALE=de
pnpm start
Output:
Initializing n8n process
n8n ready on 0.0.0.0, port 5678
Version: 0.156.0
Locale: de
Editor is now accessible via:
http://localhost:5678/

Press "o" to open in Browser.
Base text
Base text is rendered with no dependencies, i.e. base text is fixed and does not change
in any circumstances. Base text is supplied by the user in one file per locale in the
/frontend/editor-ui package.
Locating base text
The base text file for each locale is located at
/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/ and is named
{localeIdentifier}.json. Keys in the base text file can be Vue component dirs, Vue
component names, and references to symbols in those Vue components. These keys
are added by the team as the UI is modified or expanded.
{
"nodeCreator.categoryNames.analytics": 
"󰎲 Analytics"
,
"nodeCreator.categoryNames.communication": 
"󰎲 Communication"
,
"nodeCreator.categoryNames.coreNodes": 
"󰎲 Core Nodes"
}
Translating base text
1. Select a new locale identifier, e.g. de, copy the en JSON base text file with a new
name:
cp ./packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json
./packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/de.json
2. Find in the UI a string to translate, and search for it in the newly created base text
file. Alternatively, find in /frontend/editor-ui a call to i18n.baseText(key),
e.g. i18n.baseText('workflowActivator.deactivateWorkflow'), and take note
of the key and find it in the newly created base text file.
Note: If you cannot find a string in the new base text file, either it does not
belong to base text (i.e., the string might be part of header text, credential text,
or node text), or the string might belong to the backend, where i18n is currently
unsupported.
3. Translate the string value - do not change the key. In the examples below, a
string starting with 󰎲 stands for a string translated from English into German.
As an optional final step, remove any untranslated strings from the new base text file.
Untranslated strings in the new base text file will trigger a fallback to the en base text
file.
For information about interpolation and reusable base text, refer to the
Addendum.

Dynamic text
Dynamic text relies on data specific to each node and credential:
● headerText and nodeText in the node translation file
● credText in the credential translation file
Locating dynamic text
Locating the credential translation file
A credential translation file is placed at
/nodes-base/credentials/translations/{localeIdentifier}
credentials
└── translations
└── de
├── githubApi.json
└── githubOAuth2Api.json
Every credential must have its own credential translation file.
The name of the credential translation file must be sourced from the credential’s
description.name property:
export class GithubApi implements 
ICredentialType {
name 
= 'githubApi'; // to use for credential translation file
displayName 
= 'Github API';
documentationUrl 
= 'github';
properties
: INodeProperties[] = 
[
Locating the node translation file
A node translation file is placed at
/nodes-base/nodes/{node}/translations/{localeIdentifier}
GitHub
├── GitHub.node.ts
├── GitHubTrigger.node.ts
└── translations
└── de
├── github.json
└── githubTrigger.json
Every node must have its own node translation file.
For information about nodes in versioned dirs and grouping dirs, refer to the
Addendum.
The name of the node translation file must be sourced from the node’s
description.name property:

export class Github implements 
INodeType {
description
: INodeTypeDescription = 
{
displayName
: 'GitHub',
name
: 'github', // to use for node translation file name
icon
: 'file:github.svg',
group
: ['input'],
Translating dynamic text
Translating the credential translation file
Note: All translation keys are optional. Missing translation values trigger a
fallback to the en locale strings.
A credential translation file, e.g. githubApi.json is an object containing keys that match
the credential parameter names:
export class GithubApi implements 
ICredentialType {
name 
= 'githubApi';
displayName 
= 'Github API';
documentationUrl 
= 'github';
properties
: INodeProperties[] = 
[
{
displayName
: 'Github Server',
name
: 'server', // key to use in translation
type
: 'string',
default: 'https://api.github.com',
description
: 'The server to connect to. Only has to be set if
Github Enterprise is used.'
,
}
,
{
displayName
: 'User',
name
: 'user', // key to use in translation
type
: 'string',
default: '',
}
,
{
displayName
: 'Access Token',
name
: 'accessToken', // key to use in translation
type
: 'string',
default: '',
}
,
]
;
}
The object for each node credential parameter allows for the keys displayName,
description, and placeholder.
{
"server.displayName": 
"󰎲 Github Server"
,
"server.description": 
"󰎲 The server to connect to. Only has to be set if

Github Enterprise is used.",
"user.placeholder": 
"󰎲 Hans"
,
"accessToken.placeholder": 
"󰎲 123"
}
Only existing parameters are translatable. If a credential parameter does not have a
description in the English original, adding a translation for that non-existing parameter
will not result in the translation being displayed - the parameter will need to be added in
the English original first.
Translating the node translation file
Note: All keys are optional. Missing translations trigger a fallback to the en
locale strings.
Each node translation file is an object that allows for two keys, header and nodeView,
which are thesections of each node translation.
The header section points to an object that may contain only two keys, displayName and
description, matching the node’s description.displayName and
description.description.
export class Github implements 
INodeType {
description
: INodeTypeDescription = 
{
displayName
: 'GitHub', // key to use in translation
description
: 'Consume GitHub API', // key to use in translation
name
: 'github',
icon
: 'file:github.svg',
group
: ['input'],
version
: 1,
{
"header": {
"displayName": 
"󰎲 GitHub"
,
"description": 
"󰎲 Consume GitHub API"
}
}
Header text is used wherever the node’s display name and description are needed:
In turn, the nodeView section points to an object containing translation keys that match
the node’s operational parameters, found in the *.node.ts and also found in
*Description.ts files in the same dir.
export class Github implements 
INodeType {
description
: INodeTypeDescription = 
{

displayName: 'GitHub',
name
: 'github',
properties
: 
[
{
displayName
: 'Resource',
name

options
: [],
default: 'issue',
description
: 'The resource to operate on.',
}
,
{
"nodeView.resource.displayName": 
"󰎲 Resource"

Building translations
Base text
When translating a base text file at
/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/{localeIdentifier}.json
:
1. Open a terminal:
export N8N_DEFAULT_LOCALE=
de
pnpm start
2. Open another terminal:
export N8N_DEFAULT_LOCALE=
de
cd 
packages/frontend/editor-ui
pnpm dev
Changing the base text file will trigger a rebuild of the client at http://localhost:8080.
Dynamic text
When translating a dynamic text file at
/packages/nodes-base/nodes/{node}/translations/{localeIdentifier}/{node}.json
,
1. Open a terminal:
export N8N_DEFAULT_LOCALE=
de
pnpm start
2. Open another terminal:
export N8N_DEFAULT_LOCALE=
de
cd 
packages/nodes-base
pnpm n8n-generate-translations
pnpm watch
After changing the dynamic text file:
1. Stop and restart the first terminal.
2. Refresh the browser at http://localhost:5678
If a headerText section was changed, re-run pnpm n8n-generate-translations in
/nodes-base.
Note: To translate base and dynamic text simultaneously, run three terminals
following the steps from both sections (first terminal running only once) and
browse http://localhost:8080.

n8n.io - Workflow Automation
n8n-node-dev
Currently very simple and not very sophisticated CLI which makes it easier to create
credentials and nodes in TypeScript for n8n.
npm install n8n-node-dev -g
Contents
● Usage
● Commands
● Create a node
o Node Type
o Node Type Description
o Node Properties
o Node Property Options
● License
Usage
The commandline tool can be started with n8n-node-dev <COMMAND>
Commands
The following commands exist:
build
Builds credentials and nodes in the current folder and copies them into the n8n custom
extension folder (~/.n8n/custom/) unless destination path is overwritten with
--destination <FOLDER_PATH>
When “–watch” gets set it starts in watch mode and automatically builds and copies files
whenever they change. To stop press “ctrl + c”.

new
Creates new basic credentials or node of the selected type to have a first starting point.
Create a node
The easiest way to create a new node is via the “n8n-node-dev” cli. It sets up all the
basics.
A n8n node is a JavaScript file (normally written in TypeScript) which describes some
basic information (like name, description, ...) and also at least one method. Depending
on which method gets implemented defines if it is a regular-, trigger- or webhook-node.
A simple regular node which:
● defines one node property
● sets its value to all items it receives
would look like this:
File named: MyNode.node.ts
import 
{
IExecuteFunctions
,
INodeExecutionData
,
INodeType
,
INodeTypeDescription
,
} 
from 'n8n-workflow';
export class MyNode implements 
INodeType {
description
: INodeTypeDescription = 
{
displayName
: 'My Node',
name
: 'myNode',
group
: ['transform'],
version
: 1,
description
: 'Adds "myString" on all items to defined value.',
defaults
: 
{
name
: 'My Node',
color
: '#772244',
}
,
inputs
: ['main'],
outputs
: ['main'],
properties
: 
[
// Node properties which the user gets displayed and
// can change on the node.
{
displayName
: 'My String',
name
: 'myString',
type
: 'string',

default: '',
placeholder
: 'Placeholder value',
description
: 'The description text',
}
]
}
;
async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> 
{
const items = this.getInputData();
let item: INodeExecutionData;
let myString: string;
// Itterates over all input items and add the key "myString" with the
// value the parameter "myString" resolves to.
// (This could be a different value for each item in case it contains
an expression)
for (let itemIndex = 0; itemIndex < items.length; itemIndex++
) {
myString 
= this.getNodeParameter('myString', itemIndex, '') as
string;
item 
= items[itemIndex];
item
.json['myString'] = myString;
}
return [items];
}
}
The “description” property has to be set on all nodes because it contains all the base
information. Additionally all nodes have to have exactly one of the following methods
defined which contains the actual logic:
Regular node
Method is called when the workflow gets executed
● execute: Executed once no matter how many items
By default, execute should always be used, especially when creating a third-party
integration. The reason for this is that it provides much more flexibility and allows, for
example, returning a different number of items than it received as input. This becomes
crucial when a node needs to query data such asreturn all users. In such cases, the
node typically receives only one input item but returns as many items as there are
users. Therefore, when in doubt, it is recommended to use execute!

Trigger node
Method is called once when the workflow gets activated. It can then trigger workflow
runs and provide the necessary data by itself.
● trigger
Webhook node
Method is called when webhook gets called.
● webhook
Node Type
Property overview
● description [required]: Describes the node like its name, properties, hooks, ...
see Node Type Description bellow.
● execute [optional]: Method is called when the workflow gets executed (once).
● hooks [optional]: The hook methods.
● methods [optional]: Additional methods. Currently only “loadOptions” exists which
allows loading options for parameters from external services
● trigger [optional]: Method is called once when the workflow gets activated.
● webhook [optional]: Method is called when webhook gets called.
● webhookMethods [optional]: Methods to setup webhooks on external services.
Node Type Description
The following properties can be set in the node description:
● credentials [optional]: Credentials the node requests access to
● defaults [required]: Default “name” and “color” to set on node when it gets
created
● displayName [required]: Name to display users in Editor UI
● description [required]: Description to display users in Editor UI
● group [required]: Node group for example “transform” or “trigger”
● hooks [optional]: Methods to execute at different points in time like when the

the amount
● outputs [required]: Types of outputs the node has (currently only “main” exists)
and the amount
● outputNames [optional]: In case a node has multiple outputs, names can be set
that users know what data to expect

● maxNodes [optional]: If an unlimited number of nodes of that type cannot exist in
a workflow, the max-amount can be specified
● name [required]: Name of the node (for n8n to use internally, in camelCase)
● properties [required]: Properties which get displayed in the Editor UI and can be
set by the user
● subtitle [optional]: Text which should be displayed underneath the name of the
node in the Editor UI (can be an expression)
● version [required]: Version of the node. Currently always “1” (integer). For future
usage, does not get used yet

Node Properties
The following properties can be set in the node properties:
● default [required]: Default value of the property
● description [required]: Description that is displayed to users in the Editor UI
● displayName [required]: Name that is displayed to users in the Editor UI
● displayOptions [optional]: Defines logic to decide if a property should be

● typeOptions [optional]: Additional options for type. Like for example the min or
max value of a number
● required [optional]: Defines if the value has to be set or if it can stay empty
Node Property Options
The following properties can be set in the node property options:
All properties are optional. However, most only work when the node-property is of a
specfic type.
● alwaysOpenEditWindow [type: json]: If set then the “Editor Window” will always
open when the user tries to edit the field. Helpful if long text is typically used in
the property

external service
● maxValue [type: number]: Maximum value of the number
● minValue [type: number]: Minimum value of the number
● multipleValues [type: all]: If set the property gets turned into an Array and the
user can add multiple values

● multipleValueButtonText [type: all]: Custom text for add button in case
“multipleValues” were set
● numberPrecision [type: number]: The precision of the number. By default, it is “0”
and will only allow integers
● password [type: string]: If a password field should be displayed (normally only
used by credentials because all node data is not encrypted and gets saved in
clear-text)
● rows [type: string]: Number of rows the input field should have. By default it is “1”

All Stripe webhook events are taken from docs:
https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types#event_types
To get the entire list of events as a JS array, scrape the website:
1. manually add the id #event-types to <ul> that contains all event types

2. copy-paste the function in the JS console
3. the result is copied into in the clipboard
4. paste the prepared array in StripeTrigger.node.ts
